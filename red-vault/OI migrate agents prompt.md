Inspect this existing app built with the Responses API and create a migration plan for whether it should move to the OpenAI Agents SDK. Do not change code.

Please:
- Map the current Responses API workflows, prompts, tools, streaming behavior, and state management.
- Decide whether the app benefits from a more agentic architecture with tools, handoffs, tracing, or streaming orchestration.
- If the migration is justified, produce a scoped migration plan toward the Agents SDK while preserving key behavior and user experience.
- If only part of the app should migrate, define the boundary and explain what should remain on the Responses API.
- Recommend tests and setup docs to add or update.
- Explain the proposed architecture changes, especially where tools, handoffs, tracing, or streaming add value.
- Finish with a migration plan, rollback notes, and a validation checklist.
